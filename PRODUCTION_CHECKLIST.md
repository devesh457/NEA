# Production Deployment Checklist

## Security Requirements

### Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set with secure values:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/nea_website"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secure-secret-key-here"  # Use a strong random string

# Admin Credentials
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-secure-admin-password"  # Change from default
TEST_PASSWORD="your-secure-test-password"    # Change from default

# File Upload
UPLOAD_DIR="./uploads"
MAX_FILE_SIZE="5242880"  # 5MB

# Environment
NODE_ENV="production"
```

### Security Measures Implemented

✅ **Debug Code Removed**
- All console.log statements removed from production code
- Error handling uses silent fallbacks in components
- Test API endpoints removed

✅ **Password Security**
- All passwords are properly hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- No hardcoded passwords in console output
- Environment variables used for sensitive data

✅ **Type Safety**
- TypeScript type assertions used where Prisma client needs updates
- Proper error handling in all API routes
- Input validation on all forms

✅ **Authentication & Authorization**
- Session-based authentication with NextAuth
- Role-based access control (ADMIN/USER)
- Protected API routes with session validation

✅ **Data Validation**
- Server-side validation on all API endpoints
- Client-side form validation
- Unique constraints on critical fields (email, employeeId)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   npx prisma generate
   npm run seed:admin
   ```

2. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify Security**
   - Test with production environment variables
   - Verify no debug information is exposed
   - Check all authentication flows
   - Test file upload limits

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Admin login works with production credentials
- [ ] User registration and approval flow
- [ ] File uploads work within size limits
- [ ] All forms validate properly
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Database migrations applied correctly
- [ ] SSL certificate configured
- [ ] Environment variables secured

## Monitoring

- Monitor application logs for errors
- Set up database backups
- Monitor file upload directory size
- Regular security updates for dependencies

## Notes

- The application uses type assertions (`as any`) in some places due to Prisma client type generation issues. These are safe as they only access known database fields.
- All user inputs are validated both client-side and server-side
- File uploads are restricted to images and have size limits
- Session tokens include necessary user data to minimize database queries
